*   **Use with Permission:** Only use this script on websites you own or have explicit permission to test.
*   **Considerations:** Be mindful of the implications of password cracking and security testing.
*   **No Guarantee of Success:** This script generates potential password candidates based on website content. There is no guarantee that these mutations will successfully crack any passwords.

## Description

This Python script is a command-line tool that crawls a website, extracts the most frequent words from its content, and optionally generates common password mutations based on those words. It is designed to aid in security assessments and password cracking exercises (for ethical purposes only, such as penetration testing with explicit permission).

## Features

*   **Web Crawling:** Crawls a website starting from a given URL, up to a specified depth, following links to discover more pages.
*   **Word Extraction:** Extracts all words from the HTML content of crawled web pages, discarding HTML tags and focusing on text content.
*   **Word Frequency Analysis:** Counts the occurrences of words and identifies the most frequent words on the website.
*   **Minimum Word Length Filtering:** Allows you to specify the minimum length for words to be considered in the frequency analysis.
*   **Password Mutation Generation:** Generates common password mutations based on the top words, including capitalization, appending years, symbols, numbers, and seasonal words.
*   **Output to File:**  Saves the list of top words and/or generated password mutations to separate output files.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Uses `click` for a user-friendly command-line interface with options for URL, depth, minimum word length, output files, and mutation generation.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.x:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
*   **Required Python Libraries:** 
    `requests`
    `beautifulsoup4`
    `click`


### Running the Script

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DilanM818/Wordlist_Generator 
    cd Wordlist_Generator   
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable (shown on Linux):**

    ```bash
    chmod +x wordlist_generator.py
    ```

3.  **Run the script with options:**

    ```bash
    ./wordlist_generator.py [OPTIONS]
    ```

    You will be prompted for the Web URL if you don't provide it as an option.

### Options

The script supports the following command-line options:
```
Options:
  -u, --url <TEXT>               URL of webpage to extract from  [required]
  -l, --length <INTEGER>         Minimum word length (default: 0, no limit)
  -o, --output <TEXT>            Output file to save results
  -d, --depth <INTEGER>          Crawling depth (default: 0, only searches given URL)
  -m, --mutate                   Generate and output common password mutations
  -mo, --mutation-output <TEXT>  Output file to save password mutations, *Note: if enabled, you must use -m as well, e.g. -m -mo*
  --help
```

### Examples

*   **Run the script and get top words from a URL, prompting for the URL:**

    ```bash
    ./wordlist_generator.py -u http://example.com
    ```

*   **Run the script, specify the URL and minimum word length, and output top words to a file:**

    ```bash
    ./wordlist_generator.py -u http://example.com -l 5 -o top_words.txt
    ```

*   **Run the script with crawling depth 1 and generate password mutations for top words, saving both top words and mutations to separate files:**

    ```bash
    ./wordlist_generator.py -u http://example.com -d 1 -m -o top_words.txt -mo mutations.txt
    ```
